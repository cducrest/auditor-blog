The purpose of this page is to store a short list of references of judging decisions, vulnerabilities, or explanations that I found noticeable.
I store them here to be used when reporting issues for future contests.

## Judging decisions

### Issues accepted as valid when they should not have

- Borrower prevent liquidation by front-running and slightly increasing collateral: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus-judging/issues/12.

- Requiring slippage protection on oracle price changes: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus-judging/issues/3

- Accounting of unused value wrong: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/137

- Bugs outside of scope impacting in-scope contracts: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/328#issuecomment-1582380098

### Change of severity due to different exploit

- An issue was de-duplicated and changed severity due to different understanding of the exploit: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-hats-judging/issues/41,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/26

### Issues rejected when they should be valid

- Bug in contracts in scope that impact out of scope contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/119#issuecomment-1580157742

## Vulnerabilities

- Chainlink oracle check for outdated data: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry-judging/issues/43 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/94

- Balancer's read-only reentrancy: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry-judging/issues/141

- External calls to untrusted contracts can use more than 63/64th of the block gas limit to prevent correct execution of remainder of transaction 
if it requires more than 1/64th of the block gas limit. ([see thread](https://twitter.com/0xOwenThurm/status/1618417556683108352))

- The `s` value of a `(v, r, s)` signature can be manipulated to make a signature that recovers to the same address if the range of s is not checked 
([see OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/1642b6639b93e3b97be163d49827e1f56b81ca11/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L124)).
The signature can be used to recover a different message for a different public key.

- attempting to transfer zero token with ERC20 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/177

- abuse the fact that ERC721 token recipients needs to implement `onERC721Received()` to receive tokens

- Compound's comptroller `enterMarket` and `exitMarket` do not revert on error: https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/03/defi-saver/#error-codes-of-compounds-comptrollerentermarket-comptrollerexitmarket-are-not-checked

## Weird tokens

- USDT can introduce fee-on-transfer: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code
- YAMv2 has 24 decimals: https://etherscan.io/token/0xaba8cac6866b83ae4eec97dd07ed254282f6ad8a
- Some ERC20 have two addresses (never found one)

## Vulnerability categories to remember

When auditing a protocol remember to check for:

- Price Oracle Manipulation
- Erroneous Accounting
- ID Uniqueness Violations
- Inconsistent State Updates
- Privilege Escalation
- Atomicity Violations
- Use of safeTransfer for ERC20
- Fee-on-transfer / rebase token
- Blacklist tokens
- Front/back-running transactions
- Signature malleability
- Parallel data structures
- Asymetrical code
- Use of unsafe delete
