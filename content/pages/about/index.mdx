I am @cducrest (@Oizo someplace), former auditor for [Brainbot-Technologies](https://brainbot.com/smart-contract-audits/).
I started gaining experience in auditing in July 2022 and educated myself in security before that.
I have been a smart contract developer and genuinely interested in web3 since early 2018.

This blog is about sharing my experience auditing projects and mostly participating in [Sherlock audits](https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests).
