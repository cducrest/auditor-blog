## Blueberry 

Blueberry is a defi yield farming protocol. It allows users to deposit collateral into `Banks` and withdraw debt tokens from it to farm yield (e.g. on Ichi). The goal of this content is to give insight on the structure of the code as audited during the [Sherlock contest](https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/41), as well as a couple of interesting findings.
