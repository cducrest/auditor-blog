OlympusDAO intends to create a non-pegged stable coin called OHM. In this audit, we were interested by what they called the SingleSidedLiquidityVault.
The idea behind it is to create a vault bound to an AMM liquidity pool (e.g. Balancer), that lets users deposit pair tokens (e.g. wstETH).
The vault will then mint OHM tokens matching the USD value of pair tokens deposited by the user and provide liquidity to the pool in a 50/50 OHM/pair token value split.
The vault can deposit the LP tokens it gets from the pool and stake them to farm reward (e.g. in Aura).

The code was reviewed as part of the [Sherlock contest](https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/50).
I ranked 4th out of 154 participants in this audit. I found 3 high and 2 medium vulnerabilities, I present my findings here.

# High: cachedUserRewards is never cleaned

## Summary

The system uses `cachedUserRewards` as a cache of the amount of reward tokens a user was entitled to but did not withdraw. However, this value is never reset to 0 so a user with cached reward will receive these rewards on withdraws when a userRewardDebts is reset to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_withdrawUpdateRewardState`, if `claim_ == false`, the value of `userRewardDebts` for the user will not be updated and the check `rewardDebtDiff > userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token]` may pass (line 583). This will set the `userRewardDebts` to 0 and increase `cachedUserRewards` by its difference to `rewardDebtDiff`. 

On the next withdraw, the user will be entitled to receive its pending rewards as well as the cached reward based on the value of `cachedUserRewards`. The value of `cachedUserRewards` is not lowered afterwhile, that is not a problem in itself because `userRewardDebts` will be increased anyway by the amount of reward token sent, so it will take into account the cached value.

However, if the user repeats the operation multiple times, the value of `cachedUserRewards` will keep on growing and never lowers. After two times accruing cached rewards, and after the userRewardDebts is reset to 0 (line 584), the user will be able to claim rewards using `claimRewards()` and receive reward equal to the amount of token cached both the first and the second time.

Example:

- Users deposits pair tokens
- They are entitled to a reward
- They withdraw 10% of their deposit with `claim_ = false`
- This increases `cachedUserRewards` by 10% of their entitled reward
- They call `claimRewards()`, claiming all their rewards and adding the reward debt to `userRewardDebts`
- They wait for reward to accrue
- They withdraw 20% of their deposit with `claim_ = false` 
- Their `userRewardDebts` is reset to 0
- Their `cachedUserRewards` is increased by 20% of their entitled reward on top of the previous 10%
- They call `claimRewards()`, claiming all their pending rewards + cached rewards of 20% + cached rewards of 10%

They received the initial 10% cached rewards twice.

## Impact

Attackers can drain reward tokens from the contract.

## Code Snippet

cachedUserRewards is increased but never lowered:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L583-L590

cachedUserRewards are used in the calculation for amount of reward token the user is entitled to:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L354-L372

## Recommendation

Reset the value of `cachedUserRewards` on withdraw instead of adding it to the `userRewardDebts` value. 

---------------------------------------

# High: Incorrect reward tracking / calculation

## Summary

The function that calculates the amount of reward token to receive `internalRewardsForToken()` divides the end result by `10**18` which is inconsistent with how the result is treated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The result returned by `internalRewardsForToken()` is `(cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]) / 1e18`. The lp token uses 18 decimals and `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` is expressed in power of 18 as suggested by `accumulatedRewardsPerShare += (totalRewards * 1e18) / totalLP`.

This result is used by `_claimInternalRewards` which adds it to `userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken]`. The values of `userRewardDebts` and `cachedUserRewards` are then transferred from one to the other in `_withdrawUpdateRewardState` under certain circumstances (line 585), which means they should have the same dimension (in terms of power of 10).

However, as we saw the value of `cachedUserRewards` for the user is divided by `1e18` in the calculation above, which means they cannot have the same dimension.

Additionally the amount of tokens transferred by `_claimInternalRewards()` should take into account the full cache and not `cachedUserRewards / 1e18`

## Impact

The cached user reward have almost no impact on the reward token that should be withdrawn by the user. The users will receive less reward token than they should if they use the cache and do not withdraw their rewards on each withdraw from the vault.

## Code Snippet

internalRewardsForToken divides the whole result by `10**18`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L354-L372

It is used in _claimInternalRewards:

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L623-L634

cachedUserRewards and userRewardDebts should be comparable:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L583-L590

## Recommendation

Move the division by 10**18.

```diff 
    function internalRewardsForToken(uint256 id_, address user_) public view returns (uint256) {
        InternalRewardToken memory rewardToken = internalRewardTokens[id_];
        uint256 lastRewardTime = rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
        uint256 accumulatedRewardsPerShare = rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare;

        if (block.timestamp > lastRewardTime && totalLP != 0) {
            uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - lastRewardTime;
            uint256 totalRewards = timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond;

            // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
            accumulatedRewardsPerShare += (totalRewards * 1e18) / totalLP;
        }

        // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
+        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare)  / 1e18 -
+            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
+
+        return cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards

-        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
-            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
-
-        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
```

# High: Pool withdraw vulnerable to flash loan

## Summary

The function from `WstethLiquidityVault` to withdraw from the pool will exit the the Balancer pool and get OHM / wstETH in proportion to the current pool balances. If the withdrawer flash loans from the pool before, they can impact the proportion of OHM / wstETH received. 

## Vulnerability Detail

As the `withdraw()` function from `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` will repay (burn) the OHM token to the protocol and only send the pair token (wstETH) to the user, the user is incentivized to flash loan OHM from the pool so he receives more pair token (wstETH).

## Impact

This attack vector is limited by the `_isPoolSafe()` function called at the beginning of `withdraw()` which checks that the on-chain pool price is not more than `THRESHOLD` away from the oracle price. Depending on the value of `THRESHOLD`, the impact is more or less severe. If `THRESHOLD` represents 1%, then the user will be able to get 1% more tokens out of the withdraw than they should.

An attacker could repeatedly deposit / flash loan / withdraw / reimburse flash loan to make a profit until the price of the pool becomes naturally too far from the oracle price. The attacker can then sell their gained pair tokens which could impact the oracle price to lower the price of pair token and attack again.

## Code Snippet

`_withdraw` in `WstethLiquidityVault`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L179

`withdraw()` in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault`, calls `_isPoolSafe()` and `_withdraw()`, then pays out only pairToken

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L252-L285

`_isPoolSafe()` uses oracle and threshold:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L411-L421

## Recommendation

Use `_valueCollateral()` to withdraw from the pool in a 50/50 usd value split based on oracle price and send out pair token to withdrawer instead of relying on pool balances.

---------------------------------------

# Medium: removeInternalRewardToken does not clean storage value for users

## Summary

The function `removeInternalRewardToken()` deletes an internal reward token from the list of reward tokens. However the values of `userRewardDebts` and `cachedUserRewards` for the token are still kept in storage.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the token is added once again in the future, we could easily have inconsistencies with the leftover storage values concerning the users. As an example if the token is added again it will have `accumulatedRewardsPerShare == 0` while some users might have `userRewardDebts` set to a high value. These users may not be able to accumulate rewards in the future for this token.

## Impact

If reward tokens are added / removed / added again, accounting will most likely be broken for some users. This is a problem even if the protocol does not intend to add / remove / add tokens if they unintentionally remove the wrong reward token from a vault, there will be no way for recovery.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L674-L703

## Recommendation

Let the function `addInternalRewardToken` to provide a value for `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` or loop through user data and delete it (should be fine gas-wise because it's cleaning storage so getting gas refunded).

---------------------------------------

# Medium: Adding reward token with future timestamp may break vault

## Summary

The vault has the possibility to add internal reward token with a timestamp in the future. Doing so will make accumulation of internal rewards fail due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to accumulate internal rewards calculates `uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;` which will revert if `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is in the future.

This function is called in `_depositUpdateRewardState()` which is called among the first steps of `deposit()` and in `_withdrawUpdateRewardState` called among the first steps of `withdraw()`. 

## Impact

Adding an internal token with a timestamp in the future will lock the vault until that timestamp is reached or the reward token is removed.

## Code Snippet

addInternalRewardToken allows lastRewardTime to be in the future:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L674-L688

underflow in _accumulateInternalRewards:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L472

## Recommendation

Check for future timestamp and assign a reward of 0.
