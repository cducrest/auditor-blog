A surprising result that was hinted at by [an issue on the Cooler audit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/223) 
is that a call to a wrongly casted interface's function reverts. 

We all knew that the function selector used to determine which function will be executed on a contract is the first four bytes of the hash of its signature: `keccak256(signature)[:4]`.
The signature being the name of the function and the type of its arguments, i.e. `transfer(address,uint256)` for an ERC20 token transfer function. The signature does not take into account the returned
value type.

It is logical that a call using the wrong signature would fail. But it is less intuitive that a call to an interface providing the wrong return value also fails.

The tested contract is the following:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;


contract ERC20 {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}

contract WrongERC20 {
    bool public worked;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        worked = true;
    }
}

contract Test {
    ERC20 public token;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = ERC20(_token);
    }

    function callTransfer() public {
        token.transfer(address(this), 0);
    }
}
```

The `Test` contract is initialized with the address of a `WrongERC20` contract. 
When callTransfer() is called, the call reverts and the transaction fails.

I believe the reason is that the code of `Test` attempts to decode the return value of `token.transfer()` as a boolean and reverts when it fails to do so (because there is no return value).

This further justifies why if I switch the return values around and make `ERC20.transfer()` return nothing and `WrongERC20.transfer()` return a boolean, the call to `Test.callTransfer()` no longer
reverts.
